    This class owns hash properties in order to accelarate the comparing and searching process within the Q-table.
    In case it is necessary, there could be added additional attributes of certain circunstancial information to be
    associated with its respective quality values.

    Attributes:
        grid: Representation of the environment (as a bunch of linked states) to dealt with.
        agent_pos: state of the agent in each step.

class Qlearning:
    '''
    This class encompasses all the necessary tools to achieve the learning and inferring process through the
    Bellman's equation. 
    It will be necessary to instance this class in the module in which the environment will be created, that is,
    where the Q-learing algorithm will be applied.

    Attributes:
        grid_resources: This parameter contains the information of each string symbol of the grid. There can be also
            added any additional object with further utility along the Qlearning process, for example, any information 
            of the environment that cannot be described as an string-reward pair.
            The structure of this dictionary is as follows: {symbol_1: [associated_reward, ends_the_episode?], ..., otherObject}
                symbol_1(key): The string of the symbol to which the information of the value's list is associated.
                associated_reward (value1): The reward as a float, being positive if suitable or negative if avoidable.
                ends_the_episode?(value2): Boolean; True if stepping into this symbol (state) ends the episode, False otherwise.
        start_state: Is an instance of the State class created in the application module containing the grid and the position from
            which the learning process is going to start in each episode. It migth be necessary to rotate this state for a overall
            perspective learning of environment by the agent.
        inference_state: Similar to the start_state, but this one appears once completed the q-table, and represents the initial state
            from where to infer the optimal policy of the environment.
        q_table: Dictionary which stores as {State_instance: [action's quality value's list]}. Represents the suitability of each action
            in each state of the envirionment with a float obtained as a weighing of the collected experience through Bellman's equation.

    Methods:
        warn_if_obstacle: warns if the position (state) in which the agent starts is an obstacle and therefore, not valid initial state.
        observe_reward_value: Recieves the symbol stepped on and gives the respective reward and the boolean's possible endding episode.
        extract_possible_actions: Actions along the grid are defined here. Currently as spatially movements directions. If necessary they 
            re-designed for other applications. 
        choose_action: This applies the E-greedy policy strategy. It could be possible to be changed for further utilities, for example, 
            to Boltzmanns strategy.
        infer_path: Deduction of the optimal policy from the Q-table with a given initial state and maximum range of steps.
        visualize_inferenced_path: String logged representation of the states resulted as optimal policy.
        visualize_max_quality_action: Seaborn and matplotlib colored representation of the maximum Qvalue in each state.
        learn: Bellman's equation process. This function coordinates most of the previously described ones and fills the q_table attribute
            with the experience collected through the specified trial and error method.
