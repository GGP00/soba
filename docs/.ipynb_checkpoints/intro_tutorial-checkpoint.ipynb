    "The SOBA tool can be provided to be used directly on two scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generic case with a space defined as a grid of a given square size (by default, half a meter on each side).\n",
    "2. Simplified case with a room defined by rooms, to perform simulations in simplified buildings that require less consumption of resources and specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "An introductory tutorial will be presented for each case, although most parameters are common or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOBA enables the performance of the simulations in two modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. With visual representation.\n",
    "2. In batch mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the tutorials, the small modifications required to use each posibility are reflected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, two added mechanisms are provided to interact with the simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use an API on a REST server to obtain information and create and manage avatars.\n",
    "2. use the external tool [RAMEN](https://github.com/gsi-upm/RAMEN) for advanced 3D-visualization on Three.js. \n",
